HOW-TO INSTALL
==============

 1. Make directory /opt/wallmator
 2. Copy the contents of opt/wallmator (recursively) to your /opt/wallmator
 3. Make directory /etc/opt/wallmator
 4. Copy the contents of etc/opt/wallmator to your /etc/opt/wallmator
 5. Make directory /var/opt/wallmator/start-scripts
 6. Make a symbolic link in /usr/local/sbin to /opt/wallmator/bin/wallmator.sh

Yeah, the above should be made into a script, but I'm lazy... uh, I mean, I'll
get to it. Like Real Soon™. Yeah.

 7. Make your system execute "/opt/wallmator/bin/wallmator.sh start" during
    startup, after all network interfaces are up.
 
Now, with the proliferation of startup managers (upstart, systemd, initng, etc
etc etc), I can't possibly code for them all.

The only way I'm *sure* will work is to insert that line into /etc/rc.local
*just* before the "exit 0" line.

 8. Configure your ipset, iptables, and iproute to your liking
 9. Run "wallmator save"
10. Done
