This directory contains files which will be auto-sourced by wallmator.sh
when wallmator.sh is invoked with the 'start' command

    wallmator.sh start

The files are usually auto-generated by 'wallmator.sh save'

You may, however, add your own files to be auto-sourced here. Just make sure
that:

  1. If you use a non-builtin command, specify the full path to the command.
     E.g.: Not 'ls', but '/bin/ls'
     
  2. DO NOT end your script with 'exit' command; the script will be SOURCE-d
     by wallmator.sh, not executed!
     
     In fact, the command 'exit' must not appear *at*all* in the script!
     
     Test a script using the following:
     
         grep -E '(^ *exit)|(&& *exit)|(\|\| *exit)' $SCRIPT_NAME
         
     If the 'grep' command above does not return anything, then the script is
     safe. Or, use the following:
     
         grep --files-with-matches -E '(^ *exit)|(&& *exit)|(\|\| *exit)' \
             /var/opt/wallmator/start-scripts/*

     This command will produce a list of 'unsafe' scripts
