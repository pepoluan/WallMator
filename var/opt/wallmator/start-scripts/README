This directory contains files which will be auto-sourced by wallmator.sh
when wallmator.sh is invoked with the 'start' command

    wallmator.sh start

The files are usually auto-generated by 'wallmator.sh save'

You may, however, add your own files to be auto-sourced here. Just make sure
that:

  1. If you use a non-builtin command, specify the full path to the command.
     E.g.: Not 'ls', but '/bin/ls'
     
  2. DO NOT end your script with 'exit' command; the script will be SOURCE-d
     by wallmator.sh, not executed!
